  ## [Installation](#installation)
  To accese the J.A.T.E web-based experience, the app is deployed here: [Not Just Another Text Editor](https://young-woodland-92227.herokuapp.com/)

  However, if you plan to run the application on your local machine follow the steps below. 
  Clone repo:

    ```md
    git clone git@github.com:jcwashington/not-just-another-text-editor.git
    ```

  You will need to run `npm run build` from your root directory to build and utilize the text editor locally

  Using either route, you can then install the Chrome App to continue using the text editor offline

  ## [Project Usage](#usage)
  This text editor is a single-page application that allows us to create code snippets regardless of our internet connection.
  
  ### [Visuals](#visuals)

  The text editor can be accessed via a heroku hosted deployed site. That URL is here: [Not Just Another Text Editor](https://young-woodland-92227.herokuapp.com/).

  As mentioned in the instructions above, you can also utilize it on your local machine either by cloning and building this project yourself, or by installing the Chrome App
